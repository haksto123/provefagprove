<summary> How To Create/Edit/Delete Quizes </summary>

You can only create, edit, and delete quizzes if you have the proper permissions.
If you only have user role the "edit quizes" tab will not show up.
- To create a quiz you will have to go in the edit quizes tab, then write the name of your quiz, add a description, and choose a category from the dropdown

- To delete you have to first delete the answers, then questions, then the quiz. Since everything is connected together you will have to do this.
